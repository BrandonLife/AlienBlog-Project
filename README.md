# AlienBlog-Project
This is our back end project for Module5 

Hi and Welcome to our Alien Project
If you are looking at our project then that means you are interested in the unknown and wish to know more

What is your project?
Our project is a discussion blog. Here you can have conversations with people from all over the world about any questions that you may have regarding Aliens or even share your experiences. We hope by having these discussions, you will become more informed and make connections that will allow you to feel as if you are not alone on this planet. 

Why the project is useful?
Our project is useful to you because it will create dialogue between people in a safe space where they do not need to feel judged by the many in society. This is a place where all thoughts are welcomed and we want to encourage not only thoughts, but data, stories,and whatever you may need to help explain your beliefs.
